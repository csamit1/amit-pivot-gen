==============
This is small python script which generates the pivot-table for a list of selected BSE stocks. The script fetches various values like current_market_price , last_traded_price , days_high , days_low etc... from yahoo finance and computes three levels of Support & Resistance (S1,S2,S3,R1,R2,R3) along with the pivot-point. 

This is just my first attempt and hence its not clean(or fast) as it involves parsing HTML page directly fetched from the yahoo finance page of a script.
